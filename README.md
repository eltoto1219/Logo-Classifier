# Logo-Classifier

List of sciprts and their purposes:

Analyze accuracy: 
  -This script evalutates the CNN given trained weights for an abitrary epoch and evaluates the test set.
Analyze loss:
  -This script plots the cross entropy loss against the number of epochs my model was trained on 
Image eval:
  -This script contains training and testing functions for the CNN given input training and testing data
  -This script can also start training at a given epoch. 
Logo_NN: 
  -The actual convolutional nueral network
Run:
  -This script defines the datasets we are working with and then the network is trained with them.
test_network:
  -This scripts takes the trained CNN and tests them against the logos that I have from trill
